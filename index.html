    <h3>Effect of Lifestyle Changes on Carbon Reduction</h3>
    <p class="chart-description">According to <a href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-and-lifestyle-report" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Founder's Pledge's Climate and Lifestyle Report</a>, <span class="bold">the most significant personal action you can take for climate is to donate effectively, followed by having one fewer child</span> (especially if you live in Western countries such as the US, where <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/per-capita-co2" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>carbon footprint is ~8X as large as someone in India</a>). This is more than 6X as effective as the next top 10 measures combined.</p>

    <h3>Effect of Lifestyle Changes Excluding Children</h3>
    <p class="chart-description">If we look at those remaining measures, all but one require fairly large investments or changes to lifestyle and routines. These are only slightly more impactful, though, than skipping a single transatlantic flight. In other words, <span class="bold">we can have a huge impact by flying less</span>!</p>

    <h3>Lifecycle Carbon Output by Device Type</h3>
    <p class="chart-description">When it comes to technology's impact on climate, flat screens and desktops are the biggest offenders, especially in energy usage. With all devices, the bulk of the impact comes in the device's production. As such, <span class="bold">the best thing you can do is to keep your device running as long as you can before replacing it</span>.</p>

    <h3>Carbon Emission by Transport Type</h3>
    <p class="chart-description">Lots of interesting data to parse through here (click the items in the legend to filter by the different emission metrics). Interesting how large the "manufacture" impact was for electric vehicles vs other transport types. <span class="bold">Every kilometer you can ride your bike vs. drive a car is ~26X less carbon</span>! Considering the <a href="" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>average commute for U.S. city dwellers is around 10 miles</a>, most of us could easily be biking instead.</p>
